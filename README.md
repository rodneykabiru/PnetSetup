## Commands for installation
### N/B remember to utilize search before pulling
```html
ishare2 pull dynamips all
ishare2 pull  bin all
ishare2 pull qemu 'number' number include [511,512 879-898]
```
An example would be the ``` iShare2 search dynamips```. An installation instructions command is located at the bottom of the page. You would therefore use ``` iShare2 pull dynamips all``` to pull all images. For iol, ```ishare2 search iol```, then for the install command, it will be ```ishare2 pull bin all```. For Vios, the installation of images is done one by one.Â
